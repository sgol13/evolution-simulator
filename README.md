# Evolution Simulator

I have created this project during my OOP course at AGH UST. It is written in Java and uses JavaFX for GUI. The program simulates a group of animals which live on a square map. The animals walk (consuming energy), eat grass (getting more energy), reproduce and die (if they run out of energy). Each animal has its own genotype that affects its way of moving. If two animals reproduce, children get mixed genotypes of their parents. You can start two simulations with custom parameters parallely and observe the results.
